for every article
  get all entity candidate with capital letter excluding stopword inside it
  If entity candidate letters > 2
    // count the word frequency in the body using regex
  Exclude all entity which letters <= 2

 Loop entity candidate
    If entity words > 2
      Add into “multiple words entity candidate”

 For every multiple words entity, create multiple possible phrases combination
    For every combination
      Check existence on “tbl_entity_tagged”, if exists then put into smaller phrases map, entity as key & entity type as value
      If not exists, then put into smaller phrases map, entity as key, 0 as value
    For every smaller phrases
      If exists on “entity candidate”, then add frequency on it
      Else add new entry on entity candidate
    If smaller phrases version exists, then remove multiple word entity on entity candidate

 For every entity candidate
    Find synonym from “tbl_synonym_keyword”, if found then increase frequency of the entity

 Get matches of entity candidate on “dbpedia_resource_category”, we call it “dbpedia matches”
  
 Get matches of entity candidate on “tbl_entity_tagged”, we call it “tagged entity matches”

 For every entity candidate
    If entity exists on “dbpedia matches”, then set entity type to dbpedia entity’s category type

 For every entity candidate
    If entity exists on “tagged entity matches”, then set entity type to tagged entity’s entity type

 For every entity candidate
    Compare it with other entity candidate’s which alias is subset of this entity’s alias, then update frequency. If the entity type is not 0 (means it exists on DB either Dbpedia or Tagged Entity)

 For every entity candidate
    If the frequency is > 1, is considered matched entities
    Else is considered unmatched entities

 For every matched entities
    If entity name doesn’t exists on “tbl_entity_geoname”
      Then, Insert it to “tbl_article_entity” (art id, entity name, frequency, entity type)
    
 For every unmatched entities
    If entity name doesn’t exists on “tbl_entity_geoname”
      Then, Insert it to “tbl_article_entity_fail”
